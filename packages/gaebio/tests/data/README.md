# Test Data for GAEB Parsing

Place a GAEB X83 XML file here named `sample.X83` (case-sensitive) for the `test_parse_print` test.

Alternatively, set the environment variable `GAEB_X83_FILE` to an absolute path of a `.X83` file elsewhere.

The test will be skipped automatically if no file is available.

Sensitive or proprietary GAEB files should NOT be committed to version control.
